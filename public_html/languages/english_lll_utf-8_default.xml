        is freely visible to anyone who wants it - I'm just saying that if a determined
        hacker wanted to crack your tree, he or she could probably do it. If you
        think about it, your username and password are going to be known by a
        lot of people anyway if you distribute it to many family members, right?
        This is especially true if you have a large family, and many people in
        your family contribute information to the tree. So it doesn't really make
        sense to use a super private password like your personal bank account

        idea to note the adoption or partner in the person's biographical file.
        In the case of same-sex domestic partners, one of the partners must be
        the &quot;mother&quot; and one must be the &quot;father&quot;. Later releases

You can start this pedigree tree with any animal in the lineage, and grow the pedigree from the starting individual.</text>
