Installation instructions:
1) Save a copy of the TUFat images directory incase you odn't like how these look on your site.
2) Unpack the zip file to your desktop.
3) Drop the .gif files into your TUFat installation's 'images' directory
4) Upload to your webserver
5) That's it, check your family tree. The main theme of the site should have changed to something resembling the screenshot attached in the zip file.

Modification Notes:
I used Photoshop to create these images. The multilayered .psd files are included in the .zip file so that you can alter as you may see fit to suit your install.


Enjoy ;->
